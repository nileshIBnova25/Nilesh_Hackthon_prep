* task-01 : bubble_sort algorithm 
 ➡️ input:  code for algorithm takes list/array of elements which is not. 
    sorted according to ascending order. 
    
 📌 logic behind bubble sort is simple two for loop first for.
    loop iterates in range of 0 to n-1 where n is length of arr/list. 
    in second for loop iterates in range of 0 to n-i-1 means one position
    before from iterater in first for loop , if loop take care of if j
    is greater the j-1 (means previous position respect to j) 
    the j's  value is assigned to j-1 & vice versa.
    
 📌 swapped is assigned to false in first for loop this takes care for 
    already sorted array/list thus if the if loop is not executed in 
    second for loop then swapped will remain false then after completion
    of first iteration of second for loop another if block break  
    the outer for loop. 
     
 ⬅️ output: sorted list/array

* how to run the algorithm 
    1) using ide in using run button after accessing the file 
    2) in shell need some changes in code but can be executed by 
    bash bubble_sort.piy
